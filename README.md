# CHub
## Inbar Pe'er, Dasha Shifrina, Angelica Zverovich, Othman Bichouna (Period 5)
## Description: 
  Our very primitive bug filled version of GitHub which we named CHub. 
## Instructions on how to use your project:
   Run make. 
   Set up a server running on one computer and determine its IP address.
   Set up a client running on another computer and enter the server's IP address. 
   Type in the github command and a file name seperated by a space. 
## Features:
  The client can create a file on the server. 
   
## Attempted:
   We tried to create push and pull. We worked on trying to send and recieve files. We managed to get the files sent working but our code for recieving the files never matched up with it so it never ended up working. 
   We also tried to implement a username system but decided to focus on the file sending and never finished it. 
## Bugs & Unresolved Issues:
