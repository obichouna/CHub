# CHub
## Inbar Pe'er, Dasha Shifrina, Angelica Zverovich, Othman Bichouna (Period 5)
## Description: 
  Our very primitive bug filled version of GitHub which we named CHub. 
## Instructions on how to use your project:
   Run make. 
   Set up a server running on one computer and determine its IP address.
   Set up a client running on another computer and enter the server's IP address. 
   Type in the github command and a file name seperated by a space. 
## Features:
  The client is able to establish a connection with the server and they are able to exchange information between them. In order to create a repo on the server, client must type in create, followed by the server name. In order to pull a file from the server, client must type in clone, followed by the file name. Pulling file is supposed to be a primitive version of pulling directories.  
   
## Attempted:
   We tried to create push and pull. We worked on trying to send and recieve files. We managed to get the files sent working but our code for recieving the files never matched up with it so it never ended up working. 
   We also tried to implement a username system but decided to focus on the file sending and never finished it. 
   
## Bugs & Unresolved Issues:
  After working on push and pull for most of the last day, we ended up breaking our code. We can't find the commit that had the previously working version and we tried for most of the remaining night to go back to that starting point but we can't find it anywhere. To see our efforts, you can check either Angelica's or Dasha's or Inbar's accounts to see all of the new repos we made to test through old code to just find everything that worked before. Our version before was able to proficiently create repos and primitively pull files from the server side. We're very sorry.
