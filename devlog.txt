fixed networking files to allow server-client connection

Worked on logging in and initiation, requires servers to hold data

added header, going to move around all functions to networking because it requires server and client interaction

setup server client connection. can check if repo exists

You can create repos.

Server client connection established. Can connect any client to the server using the server's IP address 149.89.150.128. You can type in 'create' + repo name to create a repo on the server side. Was in the process of working on cloning. So far seems like server can send the file to client but the client can't copy it. Crashing on 2nd line or so.
